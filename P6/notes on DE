Crossover for DE: First, we pick a random index from each genome. Then, we take for the first child from the first genome until the selected index, not included (if it is 3, we will take from 0 to 2), and from the second genome from the selected index until the end of the genome (if it is 4, from 4 until the last index of the genome). For the second child, we take from the second genome until the selected index, not included (if it is 4, we will take from 0 to 3) and from the first genome from the selected index until the end of the genome (if it is 3, from 3 until the last index of the genome). For example, if we had two genomes of length 4 ([0,1,2,3] and [5,6,7,8]) and the index we picked were 2 from the firt one and 3 for the second one, we would end up with the following genomes: [0,1,8] and [5,6,7,2,3]. Also, it calls mutate when it returns the two new genomes.

Mutate for DE: Firstly, it only mutates the genome 10% of the time. If it is the case, it first will pick an index from the genome and it stores information about the element of that index and a random "choice". Then, depending on the type of element, it mutates that element in a certain way:

- Hole: 50% of the time it varies its position in the map and the rest of the time it varies its width.
- Platform: 25% of the time it varies its position in the map, 25% of the time it varies its width, 25% of the time it varies its height and the rest of the time it vaires what the platform it's made of.
- Enemy: nothing happens.
- Coin: 50% of the time it varies its position in the map and the rest of the time it varies its height.
- Block: 33.33% of the time it varies its position in the map, 33.33% of the time it varies its height and the rest of the time it varies whether the block is breakable or not.
- Qblock: 33.33% of the time it varies its position in the map, 33.33% of the time it varies its height and the rest of the time it varies whether the block contains a powerup.
- Stairs: 33.33% of the time it varies its position in the map, 33.33% of the time it varies its height and the rest of the time it varies the direction of the stairs.
- Pipe: 50% of the time it varies its position in the map and the rest of the time it varies its height.
